            <div class="header">1. Allocating Housing Units to the Right People</div>
            <div class="problem"><strong>Problem:</strong> How do we efficiently allocate affordable housing units to eligible people based on various factors such as income, family size, and other criteria?</div>
            <div class="solution"><strong>Solution:</strong> Algorithm Used: Heap Sort<br>We use Heap Sort to rank applicants by their eligibility, ensuring that the highest priority applicants (e.g., families with urgent needs) are allocated housing first.</div>
            <div class="reason"><strong>Reason for Solution:</strong> Heap Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that helps in prioritizing applicants quickly. It ensures that applicants with higher priority (based on predefined criteria) are placed into available housing units.</div>
            <div class="impact"><strong>Impact:</strong> Ensures fair and quick allocation of housing units, reducing waiting times and making the process transparent and efficient.</div>
            <div class="time-complexity"><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n log n), where n is the number of applicants.</div>
            <div class="space-complexity"><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1), meaning it uses constant space for sorting.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="header">2. Recommending the Right Housing Units</div>
            <div class="problem"><strong>Problem:</strong> How can we recommend the most suitable housing units to applicants based on their preferences (e.g., location, price, and amenities)?</div>
            <div class="solution"><strong>Solution:</strong> Algorithm Used: Collaborative Filtering<br>Collaborative Filtering looks at past behavior and preferences of applicants to recommend the best housing options.</div>
            <div class="reason"><strong>Reason for Solution:</strong> Collaborative Filtering analyzes users' preferences and behaviors to suggest personalized housing units. This approach ensures that applicants are matched with units that best meet their specific needs.</div>
            <div class="impact"><strong>Impact:</strong> Enhances the user experience by offering personalized recommendations, leading to higher satisfaction among applicants.</div>
            <div class="time-complexity"><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n²), where n is the number of applicants, as it requires evaluating interactions between users and housing units.</div>
            <div class="space-complexity"><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(n), which stores the interactions between applicants and available housing units.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="header">3. Choosing the Best Locations for New Housing Projects</div>
            <div class="problem"><strong>Problem:</strong> How can we identify the best locations for building new affordable housing based on factors such as proximity to amenities, transportation, and land availability?</div>
            <div class="solution"><strong>Solution:</strong> Algorithm Used: Floyd-Warshall Algorithm<br>Floyd-Warshall calculates the shortest paths between all pairs of locations to assess accessibility and optimize location selection for new housing projects.</div>
            <div class="reason"><strong>Reason for Solution:</strong> Floyd-Warshall is effective in calculating all-pairs shortest paths, which helps in evaluating the distance from potential housing sites to important services like transportation hubs and essential amenities.</div>
            <div class="impact"><strong>Impact:</strong> By selecting well-connected locations, we improve the quality of life for residents by reducing transportation costs and ensuring easy access to essential services.</div>
            <div class="time-complexity"><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(V³), where V is the number of locations. This can be slower for very large cities but is manageable for moderate-sized areas.</div>
            <div class="space-complexity"><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(V²), as it requires storing a distance matrix for all pairs of locations.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="header">4. Ensuring Connectivity in the Community</div>
            <div class="problem"><strong>Problem:</strong> How can we ensure that all housing units are well-connected within the community, allowing easy access to communal services and neighbors?</div>
            <div class="solution"><strong>Solution:</strong> Algorithm Used: BFS (Breadth-First Search)<br>BFS is used to explore all reachable housing units, ensuring that they are connected to communal services and other units.</div>
            <div class="reason"><strong>Reason for Solution:</strong> BFS efficiently explores all housing units in a level-wise manner, making sure that every unit has a clear path to essential services like parks, schools, and hospitals.</div>
            <div class="impact"><strong>Impact:</strong> Improves overall community integration by ensuring that all housing units are accessible, which promotes a sense of connectivity and shared access to facilities.</div>
            <div class="time-complexity"><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(V + E), where V is the number of housing units and E is the number of connections (roads, pathways, etc.). This makes BFS efficient even for large numbers of units.</div>
            <div class="space-complexity"><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(V), as it requires space to store the queue for BFS and track visited nodes (housing units).</div>
