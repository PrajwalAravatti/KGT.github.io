        <div class="problem">Problem:</div>
        <p>When people park illegally or stay too long, how can we catch them and issue fines efficiently?</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution:</div>
        <p>We use a <strong>Hashing</strong> system to store records of parking violations and check quickly if a driver has broken the rules.</p>
        <div class="reason">Reason for Solution (with Used Algorithm):</div>
        <p><strong>Hashing</strong> allows us to check violations in <strong>constant time (O(1))</strong>, so it’s fast and helps issue fines without delays.</p>
        <div class="impact">Impact:</div>
        <p>Drivers who break the rules are caught quickly, and fines are issued fast. This helps maintain parking order and discourages violations.</p>
        <div class="time-complexity">Time Complexity:</div>

        <p>Drivers waste time circling around looking for parking spots, creating traffic congestion.</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution:</div>
        <p>We use <strong>Prim’s Algorithm</strong> to find the best and shortest path to the nearest available parking spot.</p>
        <div class="reason">Reason for Solution (with Used Algorithm):</div>
        <p><strong>Prim’s Algorithm</strong> helps us build an efficient route to the nearest parking spot by connecting all parking spaces with minimal cost, ensuring we avoid unnecessary detours. This algorithm works well when dealing with a network of roads or parking spots.</p>
        <div class="impact">Impact:</div>
        <p>Less time wasted searching for a parking spot, reduced traffic congestion, and lower fuel consumption.</p>

        <p>With so many parking spaces, how can we quickly find and manage available spots?</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution:</div>
        <p>We use an <strong>AVL Tree</strong> to keep parking spots organized and balanced, allowing quick searching, inserting, and removing parking spots.</p>
        <div class="reason">Reason for Solution (with Used Algorithm):</div>
        <p><strong>AVL Trees</strong> are self-balancing binary search trees that ensure <strong>O(log n)</strong> time complexity for searching and updating the parking spots, making it efficient for managing large parking lots.</p>

        <div class="solution">Solution:</div>
        <p>We use a <strong>Segment Tree</strong> to efficiently track and update parking spot availability across various segments.</p>
        <div class="reason">Reason for Solution (with Used Algorithm):</div>
        <p><strong>Segment Trees</strong> allow us to update parking spot statuses and query availability in <strong>O(log n)</strong> time, making it ideal for real-time tracking.</p>

        <div class="solution">Solution:</div>
        <p>We use a <strong>Trie</strong> data structure to store and search parking spots based on vehicle types.</p>
        <div class="reason">Reason for Solution (with Used Algorithm):</div>
        <p><strong>Trie</strong> allows for fast searches for vehicle-specific spots (e.g., electric vehicle charging stations) in <strong>O(m)</strong> time, where m is the length of the vehicle type string.</p>
