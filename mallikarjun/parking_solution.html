        <h2>1. Penalty for Parking Violations</h2>
        <h3>Problem:</h3>
        <p>When people park illegally or stay too long, how can we catch them and issue fines efficiently?</p>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>We use a <strong>Hashing</strong> system to store records of parking violations and check quickly if a driver has broken the rules.</p>
        <h4>Reason for Solution (with Used Algorithm):</h4>
        <p><strong>Hashing</strong> allows us to check violations in <strong>constant time (O(1))</strong>, so it’s fast and helps issue fines without delays.</p>
        <h3>Impact:</h3>
        <p>Drivers who break the rules are caught quickly, and fines are issued fast. This helps maintain parking order and discourages violations.</p>
        <h3>Time Complexity:</h3>
        <p><strong>O(1)</strong> (on average) because we can check violations instantly.</p>
        <h3>Space Complexity:</h3>
        <p><strong>O(n)</strong> where n is the number of parking violations stored.</p>

        <h2>2. Finding the Nearest Available Parking Spot</h2>
        <h3>Problem:</h3>
        <p>Drivers waste time circling around looking for parking spots, creating traffic congestion.</p>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>We use <strong>Prim’s Algorithm</strong> to find the best and shortest path to the nearest available parking spot.</p>
        <h4>Reason for Solution (with Used Algorithm):</h4>
        <p><strong>Prim’s Algorithm</strong> helps us build an efficient route to the nearest parking spot by connecting all parking spaces with minimal cost, ensuring we avoid unnecessary detours. This algorithm works well when dealing with a network of roads or parking spots.</p>
        <h3>Impact:</h3>
        <p>Less time wasted searching for a parking spot, reduced traffic congestion, and lower fuel consumption.</p>
        <h3>Time Complexity:</h3>
        <p><strong>O(E log V)</strong>, where E is the number of edges (roads) and V is the number of vertices (parking spots).</p>
        <h3>Space Complexity:</h3>
        <p><strong>O(V + E)</strong>, where V is the number of parking spots and E is the number of road connections.</p>

        <h2>3. Finding the Right Parking Spot for Your Vehicle</h2>
        <h3>Problem:</h3>
        <p>How do we quickly find the right parking spot for specific vehicle types (e.g., electric vehicles, compact cars)?</p>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>We use a <strong>Trie</strong> data structure to store and search parking spots based on vehicle types.</p>
        <h4>Reason for Solution (with Used Algorithm):</h4>
        <p><strong>Trie</strong> allows for fast searches for vehicle-specific spots (e.g., electric vehicle charging stations) in <strong>O(m)</strong> time, where m is the length of the vehicle type string.</p>
        <h3>Impact:</h3>
        <p>Drivers can quickly find parking spots tailored to their vehicle, improving convenience and user experience.</p>
        <h3>Time Complexity:</h3>
        <p><strong>O(m)</strong> for search, where m is the length of the vehicle type string.</p>
        <h3>Space Complexity:</h3>
        <p><strong>O(n * m)</strong>, where n is the number of parking spots and m is the average length of the vehicle type string.</p>

        <h2>4. Allocating Parking Spots to Multiple Vehicles</h2>
        <h3>Problem:</h3>
        <p>How can we allocate parking spots efficiently to multiple vehicles at the same time, avoiding overlap?</p>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>We use the <strong>Union-Find</strong> algorithm to manage the availability of contiguous parking spaces, ensuring no overlap.</p>
        <h4>Reason for Solution (with Used Algorithm):</h4>
        <p><strong>Union-Find</strong> helps us efficiently track connected components, allowing for quick allocation of parking spots without overlap, ensuring all vehicles have a space.</p>
        <h3>Impact:</h3>
        <p>Efficient allocation of parking spots during peak times, reducing conflicts and ensuring smooth operations.</p>
        <h3>Time Complexity:</h3>
        <p><strong>O(α(n))</strong>, where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is nearly constant for practical input sizes.</p>
        <h3>Space Complexity:</h3>
        <p><strong>O(n)</strong>, where n is the number of parking spots.</p>
